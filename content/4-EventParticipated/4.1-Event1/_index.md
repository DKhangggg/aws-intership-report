# IN-DEPTH REPORT: AWS CLOUD DAY VIETNAM 2025
## THEME: THE ERA OF GENAI AND COMPREHENSIVE APPLICATION MODERNIZATION

### 1. Executive Overview

AWS Cloud Day Vietnam 2025 (held on September 18, 2025 in Hanoi) with the central theme "AI Edition" affirmed the inevitable convergence between cloud computing infrastructure and Generative AI (GenAI).

This report focuses on in-depth analysis of the **Migration & Modernization Track**. This is where macro strategies are materialized through real-world lessons from industry giants in Finance, Banking, and Technology. The overarching message goes beyond simply "moving to the cloud" - it's about the journey of restructuring to achieve breakthroughs in innovation speed.

### 2. Analysis of Key Sessions & Speakers

Below is a detailed compilation of 5 core discussion sessions, focusing on the most valuable insights from leading experts.

#### 2.1. Completing Large-Scale Migration and Modernization

**Speakers:**
- Nguyen Van Hai - Director of Software Engineering, Techcombank
- Son Do - Technical Account Manager, AWS

**Content & Strategic Lessons:**

The opening session provided a realistic perspective on the journey of migrating massive workloads from on-premises to AWS.

**"Modernize-While-Migrate" Mindset:** Techcombank shared a thinking model that doesn't wait for migration to complete before modernizing, but executes both in parallel. This helps shorten time-to-market.

**Practical Lesson:** The speaker emphasized the importance of building a solid foundation from the start and a clear strategic roadmap to avoid cost and technical "traps" when scaling the system.

#### 2.2. Application Modernization with Amazon Q Developer

**Speakers:**
- Phuc Nguyen - Solutions Architect, AWS
- Alex Tran - AI Director, OCB (Orient Commercial Bank)

**Content & Strategic Lessons:**

One of the most impressive sessions on applying GenAI to the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

**Amazon Q Developer:** Visual demo of how this tool acts as an intelligent programming assistant.

**Speed & Quality:** OCB demonstrated that using Amazon Q helps automate time-consuming tasks such as: writing technical documentation, creating unit tests, and reviewing security vulnerabilities. This allows engineering teams to focus on more complex business logic.

#### 2.3. Panel Discussion: Driving Forces for Digital Transformation Acceleration

**Moderator:** Hung Nguyen Gia (AWS)

**Panelists:** Experts from OCB, LPBank Securities, and Ninety Eight

**Content & Strategic Lessons:**

Multi-dimensional discussion among representatives from Banking, Securities, and Blockchain.

**Innovation Challenge:** Speakers agreed that application modernization is the "key" to solving specific business problems: from real-time securities transaction processing to global scaling for Web3.

**Flexible Adaptation:** Sharing about building a flexible technology culture, ready to experiment and fail-fast thanks to Cloud infrastructure.

#### 2.4. VMware Transformation & Modernization Roadmap

**Speaker:**
- Hung Hoang - Customer Solutions Manager, AWS

**Content & Strategic Lessons:**

For enterprises operating large VMware systems wanting to transform.

**Safe Roadmap:** Provides a detailed "playbook" to migrate VMware to AWS quickly, optimize costs and minimize downtime risks.

**Modern Destination:** After migration (Rehost), the next roadmap is to refactor to Cloud-native services like Amazon EKS (Kubernetes), Amazon RDS (Managed DB), and Serverless architecture to achieve maximum performance.

#### 2.5. AWS Security at Scale

**Speaker:**
- Taiki Dang - Solutions Architect, AWS

**Content & Strategic Lessons:**

Security is no longer a bottleneck but becomes a driver for smooth operations.

**GenAI in SecOps:** The highlight of the session was integrating GenAI into security operations processes. AI helps analyze logs, detect anomalies and automate incident response much faster than humans.

**Security-by-Design:** Thinking of integrating security right from the architecture design and code writing stages, rather than only reviewing at the final stage.

### 3. Summary & Application Direction

Through the sharing sessions at AWS Cloud Day 2025, there are 3 main directions for software engineers and enterprises in the near future:

**AI-Driven Development:** Mastering tools like Amazon Q Developer is no longer optional but mandatory to optimize Productivity.

**Continuous Modernization:** Modernization is a continuous journey. Transitioning from Monolith to Microservices, Containers (EKS) and Serverless is an inevitable trend to ensure Agility.

**Data & Security First:** Data and security must be placed at the center of all system architectures, with strong support from advanced AI models.
